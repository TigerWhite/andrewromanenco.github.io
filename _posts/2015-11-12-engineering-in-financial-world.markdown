I am an engineer and I spent years working in financial industry (major banks across USA and Canada). Fellow developers often ask me how boring is working for a bank? The answer is … it’s very interesting. It’s interesting if one is ready to look outside of engineering box.

Finance world is huge; capital markets, derivatives, payments. etc. - all these topics are very broad. Good thing about all those instruments is that they are very logical on inside. I find that most developers can easily understand how stuff works. Another observation, most developers find finance related topic very interesting, after investing initial time to understand basics.

The most common feature for both engineering and finance is to understand how things works and, even more important, why they work this way.

I plan to cover major financial instruments and concepts with illustrative examples, from a developer point of view.

Let’s see if this plan works...
